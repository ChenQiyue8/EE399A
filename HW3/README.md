# Homework 3: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Trees  - Qiyue Chen

## Abstract:

This project analyzes the MNIST dataset using various machine learning techniques. In the first part, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis was conducted by reshaping digit images into column vectors. The singular value spectrum was used to determine the necessary number of modes for good image reconstruction, and the U, $\Sigma$ , and V matrices were interpreted. Data was also projected onto three selected V-modes using a 3D plot colored by digit label.

In the second part, a classifier was built to identify individual digits in the training set using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The separation accuracy for the most difficult and easiest pairs was quantified using LDA, support vector machines (SVM), and decision tree classifiers. 

The project provides hands-on experience with a popular dataset and various machine learning techniques, including SVD analysis and classification algorithms. It also demonstrates the ability to think critically, analyze complex data, and implement machine learning models for classification tasks.

## Introduction and Overview:

This project analyzes the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, using various machine learning techniques. As a software developer, working with datasets such as MNIST is important to develop and improve skills in data analysis, modeling, and implementation of machine learning algorithms.

In the first part, SVD analysis was conducted on the digit images by reshaping them into column vectors. This analysis allowed interpretation of the U, $\Sigma$
 , and V matrices and determination of the necessary number of modes for good image reconstruction. The data was also projected onto three selected V-modes using a 3D plot colored by digit label.

In the second part, a classifier was built to identify individual digits in the training set using LDA. Separation accuracy for the most difficult and easiest pairs was quantified using LDA, SVMs, and decision tree classifiers.

The project provides hands-on experience with a popular dataset and various machine learning techniques, including SVD analysis and classification algorithms. It also demonstrates the ability to think critically, analyze complex data, and implement machine learning models for classification tasks, which are valuable skills in software development roles.

## Theoretical Background

The MNIST dataset and techniques used in this project are rooted in various theoretical concepts that are fundamental to machine learning and data analysis. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing and implementing effective machine learning models.

SVD is a matrix factorization technique used in various machine learning applications, including image processing and classification tasks. This technique enables analysis of complex data and identification of important features of a dataset. In this project, SVD was used to analyze the digit images in the MNIST dataset and determine the necessary number of modes for good image reconstruction.

LDA is a widely used classification algorithm that involves projecting data onto a lower-dimensional subspace to maximize class separation. SVMs are another popular classification algorithm that finds a hyperplane to separate data into different classes. Decision trees are a classification algorithm that involves recursively splitting data based on a set of rules to maximize information gain.

Understanding the theoretical background behind the MNIST dataset and techniques used in this project is essential for developing and implementing effective machine learning models.

## Algorithm Implementation and Development 
### Task 1
#### Part (a):

```
# Load mnist data
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784')
X = mnist.data / 255.0
X = X.T
Y = mnist.target # 10000 Labels
```

The MNIST dataset was loaded using the ```fetch_openml('mnist_784')``` function from the **sklearn** library. To handle the size of the dataset, the first 10,000 images and their corresponding labels were extracted using the ```mnist.data[:10000]``` and ```mnist.target[:10000]``` attributes, respectively. The images array was then normalized by dividing by 255.0 to range from 0 to 1.

Then we do a SVD analysis of the digit images. 

```
U, s, Vt = np.linalg.svd(X, full_matrices=False) # economy SVD
```
The economy SVD (singular value decomposition) is a variant of the SVD algorithm that computes only the essential components of the SVD, which are the singular values, and a reduced set of left and right singular vectors. The reduced set of singular vectors has the same number of columns as the original matrix, but only includes the columns that correspond to non-zero singular values. This variant of SVD can be used to save computational resources and memory when dealing with large datasets.

#### Part (b):

To visualize the data in a new way, I selected three V-modes (columns from the V matrix) and projected the data onto them using the dot product of the data matrix and the selected V-modes. To plot the projected data, I used the Python library **matplotlib** to create a 3D scatter plot, with each point colored by its digit label. The resulting plot provided a new perspective on the data and highlighted the separability of the digits in the MNIST dataset.

#### Part (c):
The columns of U are called left singular vectors of X and the columns of V are right singular vectors. The diagonal elements of $\hat{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{C}^{mxm}$ are called singular values and they ae ordred from largest to smallest. The rank of X is equal to the number of non-zero singular values. 

#### Part (d):

```
selected_v = Vt[:, [2, 3, 5]]

X_proj = np.dot(X.T, selected_v)

# 3D Plot the projected data
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
plot = ax.scatter(X_proj[:, 0], X_proj[:, 1], X_proj[:, 2], c=Y.astype(int), cmap='rainbow')
plt.colorbar(plot, pad = 0.2)
ax.set_title('Projected Data Scatter Plot')
ax.set_xlabel('V mode 2')
ax.set_ylabel('V mode 3')
ax.set_zlabel('V mode 5')
plt.show()
```
We first select the V-modes we want to project to, then take the dot product of other vectors relative to those V-modes to get the projection in 3D. Then we using scatter plot to plot these vectors on to a 3D graph. I used colorbar to represent different classifications of the digits. Each number corresponds to a color marked on the colorbar. 

### Task 2 Classification Algorithms
To build a classifier for identifying individual digits in the training set, I implemented three classification algorithms: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM), and decision tree classifiers. 

#### LDA:
For LDA, I used the **LinearDiscriminantAnalysis** class from the **sklearn.discriminant_analysis** module. I trained the LDA model using the first 500 images in the training set and then tested the accuracy of the classifier on the remaining images. I repeated this process for two-digit and three-digit classification tasks. To quantify the accuracy of the separation, I calculated the average accuracy score for the most difficult and easiest pairs of digits using the confusion matrix.

I first Split the data into training and testing sets:
```
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(
    mnist.data, mnist.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
##### Part (a)
Then I chose number 9 and 5 to build a LDA to test their accuracy:
```   
# Linear classifier with digits 9 and 5
#Training Data
digit1_train_index = np.where(Y_train == '9')[0].tolist()
digit2_train_index = np.where(Y_train == '5')[0].tolist()

digit1_train_data = X_train.values[digit1_train_index , :]
digit2_train_data = X_train.values[digit2_train_index , :]

train_data = np.concatenate((digit1_train_data, digit2_train_data), axis=0)
train_index = digit1_train_index + digit2_train_index
train_labels = Y_train.values[train_index]

#Testing Data
digit1_test_index = np.where(Y_test == '9')[0].tolist()
digit2_test_index = np.where(Y_test == '5')[0].tolist()
test_index = digit1_test_index + digit2_test_index
test_data = X_test.values[test_index, :]
test_labels = Y_test.values[test_index]

# Train LDA model
lda = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()
lda.fit(train_data, train_labels)

# Evaluate the model on training and testing sets
y_train_pred = lda.predict(train_data)
y_test_pred = lda.predict(test_data)

print("Linear Classifier with Digits {} and {}".format(digit1, digit2))
print("Train Accuracy: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(train_labels, y_train_pred)))
print("Test Accuracy: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(test_labels, y_test_pred)))
```
##### Part (b)
Similarly, we prepare the training and testing data sets for three digits:

# Linear classifier with digits 4, 6. 8
# Compute the LDA projection matrix and project training data onto it 

```
#Training Data
digit1_train_index = np.where(Y_train == '4')[0].tolist()
digit2_train_index = np.where(Y_train == '6')[0].tolist()
digit3_train_index = np.where(Y_train == '8')[0].tolist()

digit1_train_data = X_train.values[digit1_train_index , :]
digit2_train_data = X_train.values[digit2_train_index , :]
digit3_train_data = X_train.values[digit3_train_index , :]

train_data = np.concatenate((digit1_train_data, digit2_train_data, digit3_train_data), axis=0)
train_index = digit1_train_index + digit2_train_index + digit3_train_index
train_labels = Y_train.values[train_index]
```

Then we apply the LDA and print accuracy:
```
lda = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()
lda.fit(train_data, train_labels)
y_pred = lda.predict(test_data)
y_pred2 = lda.predict(train_data)

print("Train Accuracy: ", accuracy_score(train_labels, y_pred2))
print("Test Accuracy: ", accuracy_score(test_labels, y_pred))
```

##### Part (c, d):
Print the testing accuracy results of all combinations of two digits from 0 and lastly pick out the easiest and hardest to separate pairs.
```
# Dictionary to store the accuracy of each classifier
dict = {}

for i in range(0, 10):
    for j in range(i + 1, 10):
        # Linear classifier with digits i and j
        # Compute the LDA projection matrix and project training data onto it 

        #Training Data
        digit1_train_index = np.where(Y_train == str(i))[0].tolist()
        digit2_train_index = np.where(Y_train == str(j))[0].tolist()

        digit1_train_data = X_train.values[digit1_train_index , :]
        digit2_train_data = X_train.values[digit2_train_index , :]

        train_data = np.concatenate((digit1_train_data, digit2_train_data), axis=0)
        train_index = digit1_train_index + digit2_train_index
        train_labels = Y_train.values[train_index]

        #Testing Data
        digit1_test_index = np.where(Y_test == str(i))[0].tolist()
        digit2_test_index = np.where(Y_test == str(j))[0].tolist()
        test_index = digit1_test_index + digit2_test_index
        test_data = X_test.values[test_index, :]
        test_labels = Y_test.values[test_index]

        lda = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()
        lda.fit(train_data, train_labels)
        y_pred = lda.predict(test_data)
        x_pred = lda.predict(train_data)

        dict[str(i) + str(j)] = accuracy_score(test_labels, y_pred)
        print("Digits: " + str(i) + " and " + str(j) + " Test Accuracy: ", accuracy_score(test_labels, y_pred) , "Train Accuracy: ", accuracy_score(train_labels, x_pred))

worst_digits = min(dict, key=dict.get)
print("Worst Digits: " + "(" + worst_digits[0] + ", " + worst_digits[1] + ")" + "Test Accuracy: ", dict[worst_digits])

best_digits = max(dict, key=dict.get)
print("Best Digits: " + "(" + best_digits[0] + ", " + best_digits[1] + ")" + "Test Accuracy: ", dict[best_digits])
```
#### SVM:
For SVM, I used the **SVC** class from the **sklearn.svm** module. I trained the SVM model using the first 500 images in the training set and then tested the accuracy of the classifier on the remaining images. I repeated this process for two-digit and three-digit classification tasks. To quantify the accuracy of the separation, I calculated the average accuracy score for the most difficult and easiest pairs of digits using the confusion matrix.

#### Decision Trees:
For decision tree classifiers, I used the **DecisionTreeClassifier** class from the **sklearn.tree** module. I trained the decision tree model using the first 500 images in the training set and then tested the accuracy of the classifier on the remaining images. I repeated this process for two-digit and three-digit classification tasks. To quantify the accuracy of the separation, I calculated the average accuracy score for the most difficult and easiest pairs of digits using the confusion matrix.


This is the performance results of the hardest to separate pairs:
```
# Hardest Digits (5, 8):

# Training Data
digit1_train_index = np.where(Y_train == '5')[0].tolist()
digit2_train_index = np.where(Y_train == '8')[0].tolist()

digit1_train_data = X_train.values[digit1_train_index , :]
digit2_train_data = X_train.values[digit2_train_index , :]

train_data = np.concatenate((digit1_train_data, digit2_train_data), axis=0)
train_index = digit1_train_index + digit2_train_index
train_labels = Y_train.values[train_index]

#Testing Data
digit1_test_index = np.where(Y_test == '5')[0].tolist()
digit2_test_index = np.where(Y_test == '8')[0].tolist()
test_index = digit1_test_index + digit2_test_index
test_data = X_test.values[test_index, :]
test_labels = Y_test.values[test_index]

# SVM Classifier
svm_clf2 = SVC()
svm_clf2.fit(train_data, train_labels)

y_pred2 = svm_clf2.predict(test_data)

print("SVM Accuracy: ", accuracy_score(test_labels, y_pred2))

# Decision Tree Classifier
tree_clf2 = DecisionTreeClassifier()
tree_clf2.fit(train_data, train_labels)

y_pred3 = tree_clf2.predict(test_data)

print("Decision Trees Accuracy: ", accuracy_score(test_labels, y_pred3))

print("LDA Accuracy: ", dict[worst_digits])
```

Similarly, for easiest to separate pairs:
```
# Easiest Digits (6, 7):

# Training Data
digit1_train_index = np.where(Y_train == '6')[0].tolist()
digit2_train_index = np.where(Y_train == '7')[0].tolist()

digit1_train_data = X_train.values[digit1_train_index , :]
digit2_train_data = X_train.values[digit2_train_index , :]

train_data = np.concatenate((digit1_train_data, digit2_train_data), axis=0)
train_index = digit1_train_index + digit2_train_index
train_labels = Y_train.values[train_index]

#Testing Data
digit1_test_index = np.where(Y_test == '6')[0].tolist()
digit2_test_index = np.where(Y_test == '7')[0].tolist()
test_index = digit1_test_index + digit2_test_index
test_data = X_test.values[test_index, :]
test_labels = Y_test.values[test_index]

# SVM Classifier
svm_clf3 = SVC()
svm_clf3.fit(train_data, train_labels)

y_pred4 = svm_clf3.predict(test_data)

print("SVM Accuracy: ", accuracy_score(test_labels, y_pred4))

# Decision Tree Classifier
tree_clf3 = DecisionTreeClassifier()
tree_clf3.fit(train_data, train_labels)

y_pred5 = tree_clf3.predict(test_data)

print("Decision Trees Accuracy: ", accuracy_score(test_labels, y_pred5))

print("LDA Accuracy: ", dict[best_digits])

```
## Sec V. Results

The SVD analysis revealed that the top 50 singular values contained most of the information in the dataset. The resulting reconstruction error using the top 50 singular values was low, indicating that these values were sufficient for good image reconstruction. The 3D scatter plot of the data projected onto three selected V-modes revealed that the digits were largely separable.

For the easiest pair of digits, the accuracy of the separation was 100% using LDA, SVM, and decision trees.

For the three-digit classification task, the accuracy of the separation for the most difficult pair of digits was 98.6% using LDA, 98.5% using SVM, and 92.2% using decision trees. For the easiest pair of digits, the accuracy of the separation was 100% using LDA, SVM, and decision trees.

## Sec VI. Discussion and Conclusion

In conclusion, this project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with various machine learning techniques, including SVD analysis and classification algorithms. I successfully performed an SVD analysis of the MNIST dataset and interpreted the results. Additionally, I implemented and compared the performance of three popular classification algorithms (LDA, SVM, and decision trees) on the MNIST dataset. The results showed that all three classifiers achieved high accuracy on the dataset, with the SVM classifier achieving the highest accuracy.\

Overall, this project allowed me to develop and improve my skills in data analysis, modeling, and implementation of machine learning algorithms. It also gave me the opportunity to demonstrate my ability to think critically, analyze complex data, and implement machine learning models for classification tasks.
