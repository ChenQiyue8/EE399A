This report aims to explore the application and performance of various neural network architectures in predicting future states of the Lorenz system, a set of three differential equations known for their chaotic behavior.

In the study, we train feed-forward neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Echo State Networks (ESN) to advance the solution from time t to t + ∆t for specific values of the Lorenz system parameter ρ (ρ = 10, 28, and 40). We then evaluate the trained networks' ability to predict future states for different values of ρ (ρ = 17 and ρ = 35). This task allows us to assess the networks' capacity to generalize from the training data and accurately forecast the dynamics of the Lorenz system under different conditions.

Through training each of these networks on the Lorenz system data and comparing their performances in terms of their ability to predict future states, we aim to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each neural network architecture in handling complex, non-linear time series data, such as those generated by the Lorenz system. This understanding will inform the selection and development of neural network architectures for similar tasks in the future.
