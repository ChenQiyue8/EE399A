# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing my work in data analysis and machine learning. This repository contains a collection of projects I completed during my coursework, highlighting my expertise in this field.

## Projects Overview

1. **Non-Linear Regression and Model Selection**
   - Explore non-linear regression techniques and model selection.

2. **Analyzing Face Image Relationships**
   - Investigate correlations and dimensionality reduction on the Yalefaces dataset.

3. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Trees**
   - Study SVD, SVM, and decision trees in machine learning.

4. **Feedforward Neural Network Analysis**
   - Analyze feedforward neural networks and compare them with other classifiers, including work on the MNIST dataset.

5. **Predicting Lorenz System Behavior**
   - Use neural networks to predict the behavior of the Lorenz system.

6. **SHRED Model Performance Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the SHRED model's performance on sea-surface temperature data, considering factors like time lag, noise, and sensor count.

7. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Examine the effects of reward function parameters on agent behavior.

Each project is documented in its respective README with detailed explanations, code, and insights into the machine learning concepts covered.
